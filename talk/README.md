### Connect via SSH

Before attempting your first connection, you need to set the proper permissions to the _PEM KEY_ that you downloaded previously. AWS checks on this very detail as mandatory security requirement.

```bash
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/code-server-ide.pem
```

From now on, you can use the following command to get _SSH_ access to your newly created EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/code-server-ide.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The first time you connect, you will be prompted to
> accept the host's fingerprint. That 
> [increases security](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html).

> ðŸ‘‰ It is important to point out that we choose "My IP" as origin for
> any SSH connections in _Step 6: Configure Security Group_. If you are
> attempting to connect from a different IP (maybe your phone or you
> went to meed you grandmother), you need to update that setting in the
> _Security Group_ configuration.

## Install CodeServer

To install CodeServer we follow the steps from their [official documentation](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/v3.7.3/doc/install.md):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s
```

All the necessary files will be installed under your home directory (`/home/ubuntu`), therefore, there is no need for `sudo` while installing CodeServer.

The next step is to perfor a first run of CodeServer and try to reach it via browser:

```bash
code-server --host 0.0.0.0
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The parameter `--host` is necessary to bind the 
> service to the machine's port. It is also important that
> such port is properly set up in the machine's
> _Security Group_ so **to be reachable from your IP**.

Then copy your EC2 Instance's _Public IPv4 DNS_ (see the step "check the machine statu") and paste it in your browser aiming to port `8080`:

```
# Run this in your machine's terminal:
echo "http://$(curl -s -m 0.1 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname):8080"

# You should get something like:
# http://ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080
```

> ðŸ‘‰ It is important that you use `http` (NOT `https`) as
> we don't have an SSL certificate yet installed.
> We'll do that later on.

If everything works fine, you should see the login screen:

![CodeServer Login](./cs-login.png)

In order to retrieve the auto-generated password you can run:

```bash
echo $(grep "password:" ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml | tail -1 | cut -c10-100)
```

> ðŸ‘‰ You need to stop the running process:
> 1. Use `Ctrl+c` to stop the running CodeServer
> 2. run the password command and copy it
> 3. start CodeServer again to be able to login

In order to change the default password, you can edit the file `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`, then restart CodeServer.

When everything works, you should be able to login and verify that your CodeServer works fine:

![CodeServer Login](./cs-welcome.png)

## Run CodeServer as a Service

Looking at the [ufficial documentation](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/v3.7.4/doc/install.md),
to run CodeServer as a resident service (resilient to the machine reboot) looks quite a trivial task:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
```

Nevertheless, if you just run it this way, your CodeServer won't be exposed to the Internet, because
the default configuration (`~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`) binds it to the localhost (`127.0.01`).

The following command will set CodeServer to any incoming traffic on port `8080` and restart the 
background process so to apply the changes,

```bash
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1:8080/0.0.0.0:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

You can check the contents that we applied to the configuration file with:

```bash
cat ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

And, of course, you can revert the binding at any time, so to avoid exposing unnecessary surface for
attackers, by running the opposite `sed` instruction (we will do this later anyway):

```bash
sed -i 's/0.0.0.0:8080/127.0.0.1:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The next step would be to proxy Internet traffic to our CodeServer
> instance without exposing it directly. Hopefully this is an easy task
> with [Docker][docker] and [Traefik][traefik].

## Install Docker, DockerCompose, HumbleCLI

Installing [Docker][docker] is not a big deal any longer thanks to these
wonderful tutorials by [Digitalocean]:

- [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Nevertheless, this is my compact recipe:

```bash
# Install Docker
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# Enable Docker for the "ubuntu" user
# (so that we don't have to run "sudo" with Docker)
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# You need to logout/login into your machine to apply
# the change to the user's rights:
exit
```

[Docker Compose][docker-compose] is much simpler than that and doesn't
require any kind of logout/login:

```bash
# Download the latest version from GitHub
sudo apt install -y jq
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | jq .name -r)/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"

# Make it executable:
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Optionally, you may want to install [HumbleCLI][humble] which is a small
wrapper around DockerCompose and may facilitate the running of local projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcopeg/humble-cli.git /home/ubuntu/.humble-cli
sudo ln -s /home/ubuntu/.humble-cli/bin/humble.sh /usr/local/bin/humble
 ```

> ðŸ‘‰ The next step would be to leverage Docker so to proxy CodeServer
> to the standard port `80`...

## Proxy CodeServer with Docker and NGiNX

_Why can't I leave my CodeServer exposed to 8080?_  
I'm glad you asked. Here are a few reasons:

1. It's simply easier to access it on standard port `80`
2. With a proxy like [NGiNX][nginx], we could add _SSL protection_ to it
3. With [NGiNX][nginx] (and some work) we can proxy multiple services

> ðŸ‘‰ In this step we will try to proxy the CodeServer process through
> [NGiNX][nginx], but later on we will also add [Traefik][traefik] that
> will make all the configuration a simple docker-based automation.

The beauty of running services via [Docker Compose][docker-compose] is that you can experience the real
**SaaS - Software as a Software** experience where you
describe what you want to run and how you want to run it in the form of source files.

```bash
# Generate the basic configuration for NGiNX
cat <<EOT > ~/nginx.conf
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name _;

  location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header Host \$http_host;
      proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      proxy_redirect off;
  }
}
EOT
```

```bash
# Generate the basic Docker Compose project
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.19.5-alpine
    network_mode: host
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "~/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
EOT
```

Now you can copy your host's default _DNS_ to your browser:

```bash
echo "http://$(curl -s -m 0.1 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname)"
```

And start the [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If everything works fine you should be able to see a screen like the following one:

![CodeServer Login with NGiNX Proxy](./cs-login-proxy-nginx.png)

> ðŸ‘‰ Now that we learned how to proxy [CodeServer][code-server] via
> [NGiNX][nginx], we can revert the change we made to its configuration
> and avoid exposing it directly:

```bash
sed -i 's/0.0.0.0:8080/127.0.0.1:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

> ðŸ‘‰ In the next step, we'll add [Traefik][traefik] to the 
> [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project and set it up so to
> automatically generate a [Letsencrypt][letsencrypt] SSL certificate
> for our **Cloud Development Environment**.

## Add Traefik and Letsencrypt

```bash
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
#  nginx:
#    image: nginx:1.19.5-alpine
#    network_mode: host
#    volumes:
#      - "~/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"

  traefik:
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.csi.loadbalancer.server.port=1337"
#      - "traefik.http.routers.csi-traefik-http.rule=Host(`127.0.0.11`)"
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=true"
      - "--providers.docker.network=web"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    image: traefik:v2.2
    network_mode: host
EOT
```

## Notes

```bash
sudo systemctl status code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl stop code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl disable code-server@$USER
systemctl list-units --type=service
lsof -i :8080
```
