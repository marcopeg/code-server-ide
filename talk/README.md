### Connect via SSH

Before attempting your first connection, you need to set the proper permissions to the _PEM KEY_ that you downloaded previously. AWS checks on this very detail as mandatory security requirement.

```bash
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/code-server-ide.pem
```

From now on, you can use the following command to get _SSH_ access to your newly created EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/code-server-ide.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The first time you connect, you will be prompted to
> accept the host's fingerprint. That 
> [increases security](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html).

> ðŸ‘‰ It is important to point out that we choose "My IP" as origin for
> any SSH connections in _Step 6: Configure Security Group_. If you are
> attempting to connect from a different IP (maybe your phone or you
> went to meed you grandmother), you need to update that setting in the
> _Security Group_ configuration.

## Install CodeServer

To install CodeServer we follow the steps from their [official documentation](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/v3.7.3/doc/install.md):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s
```

All the necessary files will be installed under your home directory (`/home/ubuntu`), therefore, there is no need for `sudo` while installing CodeServer.

The next step is to perfor a first run of CodeServer and try to reach it via browser:

```bash
code-server --host 0.0.0.0
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The parameter `--host` is necessary to bind the 
> service to the machine's port. It is also important that
> such port is properly set up in the machine's
> _Security Group_ so **to be reachable from your IP**.

Then copy your EC2 Instance's _Public IPv4 DNS_ (see the step "check the machine statu") and paste it in your browser aiming to port `8080`:

```bash
# Run this in your machine's terminal:
echo "http://$(curl -s -m 0.1 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname):8080"

# You should get something like:
# http://ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080
```

> ðŸ‘‰ It is important that you use `http` (NOT `https`) as
> we don't have an SSL certificate yet installed.
> We'll do that later on.

If everything works fine, you should see the login screen:

![CodeServer Login](./cs-login.png)

In order to retrieve the auto-generated password you can run:

```bash
echo $(grep "password:" ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml | tail -1 | cut -c10-100)
```

> ðŸ‘‰ You need to stop the running process:
> 1. Use `Ctrl+c` to stop the running CodeServer
> 2. run the password command and copy it
> 3. start CodeServer again to be able to login

In order to change the default password, you can edit the file `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`, then restart CodeServer.

When everything works, you should be able to login and verify that your CodeServer works fine:

![CodeServer Login](./cs-welcome.png)

## Run CodeServer as a Service

Looking at the [ufficial documentation](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/v3.7.4/doc/install.md),
to run CodeServer as a resident service (resilient to the machine reboot) looks quite a trivial task:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
```

Nevertheless, if you just run it this way, your CodeServer won't be exposed to the Internet, because
the default configuration (`~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`) binds it to the localhost (`127.0.01`).

The following command will set CodeServer to any incoming traffic on port `8080` and restart the 
background process so to apply the changes,

```bash
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1:8080/0.0.0.0:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

You can check the contents that we applied to the configuration file with:

```bash
cat ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

And, of course, you can revert the binding at any time, so to avoid exposing unnecessary surface for
attackers, by running the opposite `sed` instruction (we will do this later anyway):

```bash
sed -i 's/0.0.0.0:8080/127.0.0.1:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The next step would be to proxy Internet traffic to our CodeServer
> instance without exposing it directly. Hopefully this is an easy task
> with [Docker][docker] and [Traefik][traefik].

## Install Docker, DockerCompose, HumbleCLI

Installing [Docker][docker] is not a big deal any longer thanks to these
wonderful tutorials by [Digitalocean]:

- [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Nevertheless, this is my compact recipe:

```bash
# Install Docker
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# Enable Docker for the "ubuntu" user
# (so that we don't have to run "sudo" with Docker)
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# You need to logout/login into your machine to apply
# the change to the user's rights:
exit
```

[Docker Compose][docker-compose] is much simpler than that and doesn't
require any kind of logout/login:

```bash
# Download the latest version from GitHub
sudo apt install -y jq
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | jq .name -r)/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"

# Make it executable:
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Optionally, you may want to install [HumbleCLI][humble] which is a small
wrapper around DockerCompose and may facilitate the running of local projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcopeg/humble-cli.git /home/ubuntu/.humble-cli
sudo ln -s /home/ubuntu/.humble-cli/bin/humble.sh /usr/local/bin/humble
 ```

> ðŸ‘‰ The next step would be to leverage Docker so to proxy CodeServer
> to the standard port `80`...

## Proxy CodeServer with Docker and NGiNX

_Why can't I leave my CodeServer exposed to 8080?_  
I'm glad you asked. Here are a few reasons:

1. It's simply easier to access it on standard port `80`
2. With a proxy like [NGiNX][nginx], we could add _SSL protection_ to it
3. With [NGiNX][nginx] (and some work) we can proxy multiple services

> ðŸ‘‰ In this step we will try to proxy the CodeServer process through
> [NGiNX][nginx], but later on we will also add [Traefik][traefik] that
> will make all the configuration a simple docker-based automation.

The beauty of running services via [Docker Compose][docker-compose] is that you can experience the real
**SaaS - Software as a Software** experience where you
describe what you want to run and how you want to run it in the form of source files.

```bash
# Generate the basic configuration for NGiNX
cat <<EOT > ~/nginx.conf
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name _;

  location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header Host \$http_host;
      proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      proxy_redirect off;
  }
}
EOT
```

```bash
# Generate the basic Docker Compose project
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.19.5-alpine
    network_mode: host
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "~/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
EOT
```

Now you can copy your host's default _DNS_ to your browser:

```bash
echo "http://$(curl -s -m 0.1 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname)"
```

And start the [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If everything works fine you should be able to see a screen like the following one:

![CodeServer Login with NGiNX Proxy](./cs-login-proxy-nginx.png)

> ðŸ‘‰ Now that we learned how to proxy [CodeServer][code-server] via
> [NGiNX][nginx], we can revert the change we made to its configuration
> and avoid exposing it directly:

```bash
sed -i 's/0.0.0.0:8080/127.0.0.1:8080/g' ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

> ðŸ‘‰ In the next step, we'll add [Traefik][traefik] to the 
> [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project and set it up so to
> automatically generate a [Letsencrypt][letsencrypt] SSL certificate
> for our **Cloud Development Environment**.

## Handle Multiple Services With Traefik

[Traefik][traefik] is a **zero config reverse proxy** that goes extremely well with
[Docker][docker] as it can listen to running containers and automagically adapt so to
route traffic to them.

The following [Docker Compose][docker-compose] file is the bare miminum that is needed
to run [Traefik][traefik]:

```bash
# Generate the basic Docker Compose project
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    command:
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--providers.docker.network=web"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 8080:8080
EOT
```

It spins up [Traefik][traefik] and configures it so to listen to the [Docker][docker] daemon
for new containers coming up, or existing one going away. When Docker changes, Traefik will adapt to it.

> ðŸ‘‰ In order to try this configuration, you first need to stop your [CodeServer][code-server] service that
> is running in background, as Traefik also needs to serve contents to port `8080`.

```bash
# Stop Code Server:
sudo systemctl stop code-server@$USER

# Stop and remove any running container:
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Run the new project:
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can open your machine's DNS to port 8080:

```bash
echo "http://$(curl -s -m 0.1 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname):8080"
```

and get a result similar to the one in this picture:

![Traefik Dashboard](./traefik-dashboard.png)

The next step is to work on this [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project and add more services to it, and to learn how to route them using labels:

```bash
# Generate the basic Docker Compose project
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:

  # Traefik Proxy Service
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    command:
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--providers.docker.network=web"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

  # A Web Application
  app1:
    image: nginx:1.19-alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app1.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app1.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)"
EOT
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Please note that for this to work we had to give
> Traefik direct access to the Docker's socker file
> in _read-only_ mode.

With this project running, you should be still able to access the Traefik's console at port `8080`, and an _NGiNX welcome page_ at port `80`.

![NGiNX Welcome Page](./nginx-welcome-page.png)

If you click on the `Explore ->` link in the _Routers_ panel, you will end up in a page that lists all the routing rules that Traefik was able to pick up from Docker:

![Traefik HTTP Routers](./traefik-http-routers-first-rule.png)

So far, we we simply managed to route a new container through Traefik (just another container) using only [container's labels](https://adilsoncarvalho.com/use-labels-on-your-docker-images-3abe4477e9f5). It is now time to explore some more interesting possibilities.

With the following [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project we are going to:

1. remove the need for port `8080`  
   <small>(we want to youse it for [Code Server][code-server], and we don't really want to expose it directly!)</small>
2. route Traefik's dashboard with Traefik itself
3. route an NGiNX app as `/app1`
4. route an Apache app as `/app2`

```bash
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:

  # Traefik Proxy Service
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    command:
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--providers.docker.network=web"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port=1337"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.service=api@internal"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)"

  # A Web Application
  app1:
    image: nginx:1.19-alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app1.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app1.rule=PathPrefix(`/app1`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app1.middlewares=app1-stripprefix"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.app1-stripprefix.stripprefix.prefixes=/app1"

  # Another Web Application
  app2:
    image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app2.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app2.rule=PathPrefix(`/app2`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app2.middlewares=app2-stripprefix"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.app2-stripprefix.stripprefix.prefixes=/app2"
EOT
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Remember to kill all running containers when you switch to a new project (while following this tutorial)

```bash
# Stop and remove any running container:
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

Once this is running, you should try to access the following urls:

```bash
http://your-dns/      -> Traefik console
http://your-dns/app1  -> NGiNX Welcome Page
http://your-dns/app2  -> Apache2 welcome page
```

If you explore again the Router's page you will notice that we have now a few more rules:

![Multiple Routers with Traefik](./traefik-multiple-routers.png)

There are a few points worth of notice here:

1. Traefik is just a containers like others, so we can route it using Traefik's labels
2. Each containers must define a **unique router name**
3. We used a `PathPrefix` rule to explain how to rotue requests, but Traefik offers much more than this one
4. We configured middlewares that stripe away the subpath
rule that we use to identify a service. This is how we can extend Traefik's capabilities

Long story short, [Traefik][traefik] is really cool and I feel I just started to scratch the surface of it ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤Ÿ.

## Proxy CodeServer with Traefik

Now that we have the basics for running a reverse proxy and dynamically route traffik through it, it is about time that we setup our project to route CodeServer and the Traefik dashboard so that:

```bash
http://your-dns/         -> CodeServer IDE
http://your-dns/traefik  -> Traefik Dashboard
```

Here is the new [Docker Compose][docker-compose] project:

```bash
cat <<EOT > ~/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:

  # Traefik Proxy Service
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    command:
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--providers.docker.network=web"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      - 80:80
    network_mode: host
    restart: on-failure
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port=1337"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.service=api@internal"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.rule=PathPrefix(`/traefik`) || PathPrefix(`/api`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik.middlewares=traefik-stripprefix"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.traefik-stripprefix.stripprefix.prefixes=/traefik"

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    network_mode: host
    restart: on-failure
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.nginx.loadbalancer.server.port=8082"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx-http.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx-http.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)"
EOT
```

Before you run it, remember to restart the Code Server's background process:

```bash
# Stop and remove any running container:
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Restart Code Server
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER

# Run the Docker Compose project
docker-compose up -d
```

When everything works fine, you should be able to:

- run VSCode IDE from your machine's default DNS
- run the Terminal as you were running an SSH session
- add new containers to Docker and route them via labels

Cool, isn't it?


## Notes

```bash
sudo systemctl status code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl stop code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
sudo systemctl disable code-server@$USER
systemctl list-units --type=service
lsof -i :8080
```
